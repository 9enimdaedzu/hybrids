# How to Fly the C-46 Commando in FSX and P3D
 
The C-46 Commando is a classic twin-engine transport aircraft that was used by the US military and civilian operators during and after World War II. It is also known as the "Flying Coffin" because of its frequent mechanical failures and fuel tank explosions. However, despite its reputation, the C-46 is a versatile and powerful aircraft that can handle challenging conditions and heavy loads.

If you want to experience flying this historic aircraft in your flight simulator, you can download the C-46 Commando package from Just Flight. This package includes military, cargo and civilian passenger variants of the aircraft as well as military and civilian cockpit configurations. The aircraft are modelled using real-world plans and feature multiple animations and highly detailed engines[^1^]. The virtual cockpit has 3D instrumentation, realistic systems functionality and a choice of modern or original avionics[^2^]. The package also comes with 19 military and civilian liveries, realistic flight dynamics and an authentic R2800 twin-row radial sound set[^1^].
 
To fly the C-46 Commando in FSX or P3D, you need to have Flight Simulator X (Acceleration, Gold or Steam Edition required) or Prepar3D v4/v3/v2/v1 installed on your computer. You also need a 2.0GHz or any Dual Core processor, 2GB RAM, 1GB graphics card and 2GB hard drive space[^1^]. The C-46 Commando package is compatible with both FSX and P3D and costs US$39.99[^1^]. You can buy it online from Just Flight's website or from other flight sim retailers.
 
Once you have installed the C-46 Commando package, you can select it from the aircraft menu in your flight simulator. You can choose from different variants, liveries and cockpit configurations depending on your preference. You can also adjust the payload and fuel settings to suit your flight plan. The C-46 Commando has a maximum takeoff weight of 56,000 lbs and a cruising speed of 200 knots[^3^]. It can carry up to 40 passengers or 15,000 lbs of cargo[^3^]. It has a range of 1,200 nautical miles with full load or 3,000 nautical miles with ferry tanks[^3^].
 
To start the engines, you need to follow the checklist provided in the manual or use the Ctrl+E shortcut. The C-46 Commando has two Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp radial engines that produce 2,000 hp each[^3^]. You need to monitor the engine gauges carefully and avoid overboosting or overheating them. You also need to manage the propeller pitch, mixture and cowl flaps to optimize performance and fuel efficiency. The C-46 Commando has a tricycle landing gear that can be retracted or extended using the G key. It also has flaps that can be deployed using the F5-F8 keys.
 
To fly the C-46 Commando, you need to use the yoke, rudder pedals and throttle levers to control the pitch, yaw and power of the aircraft. You can also use the autopilot or the modern avionics if you prefer. The C-46 Commando is stable and responsive in flight, but it can be affected by crosswinds and turbulence. You need to maintain a safe airspeed and altitude at all times and follow the flight rules and regulations. You can also use the radio or GPS to communicate with air traffic control or navigate to your destination.
 
To land the C-46 Commando, you need to reduce speed and power gradually and align with the runway. You need to deploy the flaps and gear at the appropriate times and adjust the pitch and throttle to maintain a smooth descent. You need to flare slightly before touchdown and apply brakes gently to slow down. You need to steer with the rudder pedals and avoid skidding or swerving on the ground.
 
The C-46 Commando is a challenging but rewarding aircraft to fly in your flight simulator. It offers a realistic and immersive experience of flying a vintage transport aircraft that has a rich history and legacy. If you are looking for a new challenge or a change of pace from your usual flights, you should give the C-46 Commando a try.
