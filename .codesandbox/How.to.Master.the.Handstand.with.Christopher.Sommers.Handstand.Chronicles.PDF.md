## What are the benefits of handstands?
  
Handstands are not only fun and challenging, but they also offer many health and fitness benefits for your body and mind. Here are some of the benefits of handstands that will make you want to stand upside down every day:

1. **Building core strength.** One of the biggest benefits that you can get from doing handstands on the daily is the building of your core strength. Of course, handstands train your arms and shoulders to be stronger, but that isn't all. Being upside down and standing on your hands forces you to engage your core very much[^4^]. Your core muscles are responsible for stabilizing your spine and pelvis, as well as supporting your organs and posture. A strong core can help you prevent back pain, improve your balance, and enhance your athletic performance.
2. **Improving balance.** Another benefit of handstands is that they can improve your balance and proprioception. Proprioception is the sense of knowing where your body is in space and how to adjust it accordingly. When you do a handstand, you have to constantly make small corrections to keep yourself from falling over. This trains your brain and nervous system to coordinate your muscles more efficiently[^2^]. Improving your balance and proprioception can help you prevent injuries, improve your posture, and perform better in other sports and activities.
3. **Boosting mood.** Handstands can also boost your mood and reduce stress levels. When you invert yourself, you increase the blood flow to your brain, which can have an energizing and calming effect[^2^]. Inverting can also stimulate the release of endorphins, serotonin, and dopamine, which are neurotransmitters that make you feel happy and relaxed[^3^]. Additionally, handstands can lower the production of cortisol, which is a hormone that causes inflammation and anxiety[^2^]. Doing handstands regularly can help you cope with negative emotions and promote mental well-being.
4. **Enhancing circulation.** Handstands can also enhance your circulation and lymphatic system. Circulation is the process of delivering oxygen and nutrients to your cells and removing waste products from them. Lymphatic system is the network of vessels and nodes that carries lymph fluid throughout your body. Lymph fluid helps fight infections and remove toxins from your tissues. When you do a handstand, you reverse the effects of gravity on your blood and lymph flow[^2^]. This can help improve your immune system, lower blood pressure, reduce swelling, and prevent varicose veins.
5. **Supporting bone health.** Handstands are also a weight-bearing exercise, which means they put stress on your bones and stimulate them to grow stronger. Weight-bearing exercises are important for preventing osteoporosis, which is a condition where your bones become weak and brittle. Handstands can help strengthen your wrists, arms, shoulders, spine, hips, and legs[^3^]. By doing handstands regularly, you can protect your bones from fractures and maintain a healthy bone density.

As you can see, handstands are more than just a cool party trick. They are a powerful exercise that can benefit your whole body and mind. By following Christopher Sommer's Handstand Chronicles PDF, you can learn how to do handstands safely and effectively. You will also discover how to progress from basic to advanced handstand variations and challenges. With consistent practice and guidance from Christopher Sommer's Handstand Chronicles PDF, you will be able to master the handstand and enjoy its many benefits.
